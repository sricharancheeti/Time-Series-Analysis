# Time-Series-Analysis
The objective of this research is to analyze the relationship between macroeconomic indicators and the volatility of the health and energy industries. The findings can be useful for investors to diversify their portfolio by focusing on the macroeconomic factors that have historically influenced these industries. We will examine industry-specific ETFs, which track a group of companies belonging to the same industry. Additionally, we will use the various models to compute the volatility response variable. Understanding the impact of macroeconomic factors on these industries can guide investors in making informed decisions about hedging strategies.
